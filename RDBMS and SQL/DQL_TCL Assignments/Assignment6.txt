Data Recovery using Transaction Logs

1.Redo Phase:- The DBMS will check the transaction log and re-apply Transaction B because it was commited
               but not yet written to disk. This ensure the new order is correctly added to the database
2.Undo Phase :- The DBMS will undo the effects of Tranaaction A and c because they were not commited at the time 
               of the crash. This means any changes made by these transaction will be revert to maintain database consistency.
