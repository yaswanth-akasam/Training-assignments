Business Scenario:
A bookstore wants to manage its operations using a database. The bookstore sells books, and each book can have multiple authors but belongs to one category. Customers can purchase multiple books in a single order. Each order is handled by an employee, and customers can place multiple orders over time. The bookstore also keeps track of suppliers for each book.
