ACID Properties of a Transaction:-

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability

1.Atomicity:- Ensuring that a transaction is treated as a single unit of operation.
              This means that either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfullu, or non of the are.
              if any part of the transaction is rolled back.
2.Consistency:- Ensuring that a transaction bring the database from one valid state to another valid state.
                Any data written to the database must be valid according to all define rules, including constraints,cascades, 
                and triggers.
3.Isolation :- Ensure that concurrently executed transaction do not affect each other. 
               The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transaction until the transaction from interfering with each other.
4.Durability:- Ensure that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so,
               even in the case of a system failure.This means that committed data will bw saved and protected from data loss.

SQL Statement to simulate a Transaction

  CREATE TABLE account (
     account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     balance DECIMAL(10,2),
     transaction_data DATETIME,
     FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCE accounts(account_id)
     );

INSERT INTO account(account_id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000.00);
INSERT INTO account(account_id, balance) VALUES (2, 1500.00);

START TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM account WHERE account_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
SELECT * FROM account WHERE account_id = 2 FOR UPDATE;

UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_id = 2;

INSERT INTO transaction (trans_id, account_id, amount, tranc_date)
VALUES (1,1,-200, NOW()),(2,2,200,NOW());

COMMIT;


Demonstration isolation Levels

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

START TRANSACTION;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id =1;

UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
COMMIT;
