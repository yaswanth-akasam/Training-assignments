Test-Driven Development (TDD)123:
----------------------------------
Approach: In TDD, developers write tests before writing the code for the application. The process is repeated iteratively.

Benefits:
---------
Ensures that all code is covered by tests1.
Helps in designing cleaner interfaces1.
Reduces time spent on debugging1.
Makes the code more maintainable1.

Drawbacks:
---------
Requires changes in mindset and discipline1.
Initial development phase can be slower due to the need to write tests1.
Suitability: TDD is suitable for projects where requirements are clear and stable. It’s also beneficial when working on large projects with a team of developers1.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)456:
------------------------------------
Approach: BDD extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers and domain experts can read.
Benefits:
---------
Improves communication between tech and non-tech teams4.
Focuses on the system’s behavior4.
Helps to develop software that meets the business and user requirements4.
Drawbacks:
---------
Requires a substantial initial investment in writing test cases4.
Can be overkill for simple projects4.
Suitability: BDD is suitable for projects where clear communication between developers and business stakeholders is crucial. It’s also beneficial for complex projects where behavior is the primary focus4.

Feature-Driven Development (FDD)78910:
-------------------------------------
Approach: FDD is a model-driven, short-iteration process. It begins with establishing an overall model shape, then building a features list, and finally planning by feature.
Benefits:
---------
Delivers frequent, tangible, working results repeatedly7.
Highly scalable and can be used by large teams7.
Emphasizes quality aspects such as developing by feature and individual class (code) ownership7.
Drawbacks:
----------
Not suitable for smaller projects7.
Requires a significant amount of documentation7.
Suitability: FDD is suitable for larger size projects or organizations, and where the scope of the project is clearly defined7.
