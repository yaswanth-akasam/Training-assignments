Requirement Gathering: Mahindra Motors involves many stakeholders and suppliers around the world,
which makes its supply chain rather complex and data-heavy1. The main requirement was to create 
a robust online supply chain solution that would encompass the entire logistics process starting 
with auto parts and steel suppliers and ending with subcontractors and car dealerships around the world1.

Design: The design phase involved planning how to streamline data input and eliminate redundancies
from the old supply chain management system1. The legacy system ran on the IBM AS400 server, 
which allows for impressive flexibility, but it no longer sufficed for Mitsubishi’s growing needs1.

Implementation: During the implementation phase, the team developed the new supply chain management system. 
This involved a lot of coding and integration work1.

Testing: The testing phase ensured that the system performs well across different user scenarios1. 
Any bugs or issues found during this phase were fixed before moving on to the deployment phase1.

Deployment: Once the system passed testing, it underwent deployment, where it was integrated 
into Mitsubishi’s platform1. This phase ensured that the system was ready for use in a live environment1.

Maintenance: The maintenance phase involved continuous monitoring to ensure
the system’s performance remains optimal, and regular updates were made to improve accuracy and relevance1.
