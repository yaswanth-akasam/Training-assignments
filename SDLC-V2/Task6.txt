# Agile Project Plan

## Feature: User Authentication System

### Backlog Items

1. **User Registration** - As a new user, I want to be able to register so that I can create a new account.
   - Story Points: 3

2. **User Login** - As a registered user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my account.
   - Story Points: 2

3. **Password Reset** - As a user, I want to be able to reset my password in case I forget it.
   - Story Points: 2

4. **Email Verification** - As a new user, I want to verify my email address to ensure the security of my account.
   - Story Points: 3

5. **Two-Factor Authentication** - As a user, I want to enable two-factor authentication to enhance the security of my account.
   - Story Points: 5

### Prioritized User Stories

1. User Registration
2. Email Verification
3. User Login
4. Password Reset
5. Two-Factor Authentication

This is a high-level plan and the actual implementation may require breaking down these user stories into smaller tasks. The story points are estimated based on the relative complexity of each item. Remember, in Agile, plans are flexible and can change based on feedback and new information. This plan should be revisited and updated regularly throughout the project.
