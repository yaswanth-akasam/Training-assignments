Write a Test: Start by writing a test for a feature or function that you want to implement. This test should fail initially because the feature or function doesn’t exist yet.

Run the Test: Run the test and see it fail. This confirms that your test is set up correctly and that it can fail.

Write the Code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Don’t worry about perfecting the code at this stage.

Run the Test Again: Run the test again. If it passes, you can be confident that your new code works as expected.
Refactor the Code: Now that your test passes, you can refactor your code to improve its structure or efficiency without worrying about breaking it. If you do break it, you’ll know immediately because the test will fail.

Repeat: Repeat the process for each new feature or function that you want to implement.

Benefits of TDD:
------------------

Bug Reduction: Writing tests before code helps catch bugs early in the development process, when they’re easier and cheaper to fix.

Software Reliability: Because each feature or function is thoroughly tested before it’s implemented, you can be confident that your software works as expected.

Simplified Debugging: 
--------------------
If a bug does occur, it’s easier to find and fix because you know that each feature or function is tested separately.

Improved Design: The need to make code testable often results in better software design and higher quality code.
Code Refactoring: With a suite of tests, developers can refactor code with confidence, knowing that if something breaks, they will know immediately.
